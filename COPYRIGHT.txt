/* This software is released under a license derived from the libpng
 * license (see LICENSE, below).
 *
 * The most recent version of pngcrush can be found at SourceForge in
 * http://pmt.sf.net/pngcrush/
 *
 * This program reads in a PNG image, and writes it out again, with the
 * optimum filter_method and zlib_level.  It uses brute force (trying
 * filter_method none, and libpng adaptive filtering, with compression
 * levels 3 and 9).
 *
 * Optionally, it can remove unwanted chunks or add gAMA, sRGB, bKGD,
 * tEXt/zTXt, and tRNS chunks.  It will remove some chunks such as gAMA,
 * cHRM, pHYs, and oFFs when their data fields contain all zero, which is a
 * mistake.
 *
 * Uses libpng and zlib.  This program was based upon libpng's pngtest.c.
 *

 *
 * The pngcrush computer program is supplied "AS IS".  The Author disclaims all
 * warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, the
 * warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.  The
 * Author assumes no liability for direct, indirect, incidental, special,

 * the user.
 *
 * EXPORT CONTROL
 *
 * I am not a lawyer, but I believe that the Export Control Classification
 * Number (ECCN) for pngcrush is EAR99, which means not subject to export
 * controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it
 * and cexcept.c, libpng, and zlib, which may be bundled with pngcrush, are
 * all open source, publicly available software, that do not contain any
 * encryption software. See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).
 *
 * TRADEMARK:
 *
 * The name "pngcrush" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
 * as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because pngcrush has
 * been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1998,
 * the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
 * jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.
 *
 * CEXCEPT COPYRIGHT, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE:
 *
 * The cexcept.h header file which is bundled with this software
 * is conveyed under the license and disclaimer described in lines 10
 * through 18 of cexcept.h.
 *
 * LIBPNG COPYRIGHT, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE:
 *
 * If libpng is bundled with this software, it is conveyed under the
 * libpng license (see COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE, in png.h).
 *
 * If intel_init.c and filter_sse2_intrinsics.c are bundled with this
 * software, they are conveyed under the libpng license (see the
 * copyright notices within those files and the COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER,
 * and LICENSE in png.h).
 *
 * ZLIB COPYRIGHT, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE:
 *
 * If zlib is bundled with this software, it is conveyed under the
 * zlib license (see the copyright notice, disclaimer, and license
 * appearing in zlib.h).
 *
 * ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:
 *
 * Thanks to Greg Roelofs for various bug fixes, suggestions, and
 * occasionally creating Linux executables.
 *
 * Thanks to Stephan Levavej for some helpful suggestions about gcc compiler
 * options and for a suggestion to increase the Z_MEM_LEVEL from default.
 *
 * Thanks to others who have made bug reports and suggestions mentioned
 * in the change log.
 *
 * CAUTION:
 *
 * There is another version of pngcrush that has been distributed by
 * Apple since mid-2008 as a part of the Xcode SDK.   Although it claims
 * to be pngcrush by Glenn Randers-Pehrson, it has additional options
 * "-iPhone", "-speed", "-revert-iphone-optimizations", and perhaps others.
 * It is an "altered version".  I've seen output from a 2006 version that
 * says on its help screen, "and modified by Apple as indicated in the
 * sources".
 *
 * It writes files that have the PNG 8-byte signature but are not valid PNG
 * files (instead they are "IOS-optimized PNG files"), due to at least
 *
 *  1. the presence of the CgBI chunk ahead of the IHDR chunk;
 *  2. nonstandard deflate compression in IDAT, iCCP, and perhaps zTXt chunks
 *     (I believe this only amounts to the omission of the zlib header from
 *     the IDAT and perhaps other compressed chunks);
 *  3. Omission of the CRC bytes from the IDAT chunk and perhaps other chunks;
 *  4. the use of premultiplied alpha in color_type 6 files; and
 *  5. the sample order, which is ARGB instead of RGBA in color_type 6 files.
 *
 * See http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/CgBI_file_format for more info.
 *
 * Although there is no loss in converting a CgBI PNG back to a regular
 * PNG file, the original PNG file cannot be losslessly recovered from such
 * files because of the losses that occurred during the conversion to
 * premultiplied alpha.
 *
 * Most PNG decoders will recognize the fact that an unknown critical
 * chunk "CgBI" is present and will immediately reject the file.
 *
 * It is said that the Xcode version of pngcrush is automatically applied
 * when PNG files are prepared for downloading to the iPhone unless the
 * user takes special measures to prevent it.
 *
 * It is said that the Xcode pngcrush does have a command to undo the
 * premultiplied alpha.  It's not theoretically possible, however, to recover
 * the original file without loss.  The underlying color data will either be
 * reduced in precision, or, in the case of fully-transparent pixels,
 * completely lost.
 *
 * I have not seen the source for the Xcode version of pngcrush.  All I
 * know, for now, is from running "strings -a" on an old copy of the
 * executable, looking at two Xcode-PNG files, and reading Apple's patent
 * application <http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2008/0177769.html>.  Anyone
 * who does have access to the revised pngcrush code cannot show it to me
 * anyhow because of their Non-Disclosure Agreement with Apple.
